# Abstract
This project aims to explore WhatsApp chat data using data analytics techniques implemented in Python. The analysis will include tasks such as data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns, trends, and insights from the conversations. Techniques such as natural language processing (NLP) will be employed to extract meaningful information from text data, including sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and named entity recognition. Visualization techniques will also be utilized to present the findings in a clear and understandable manner. The outcomes of this project can provide valuable insights into communication patterns, sentiment dynamics, and topic preferences within the WhatsApp chat dataset, offering potential applications in areas such as social network analysis, market research, and customer feedback analysis.
